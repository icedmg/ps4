/*
This file controls the website's default payloads. It may be changed by future
website updates. If you just want to add more payloads, edit "custom.js"
instead.

For a fresh start, you can remove all payload entries below and corresponding
payload files, but you need to keep the files (not the entries) "jbc_loader.bin"
and "mira_loader.bin".
